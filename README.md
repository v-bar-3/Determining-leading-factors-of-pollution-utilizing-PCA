# Determining leading factors of pollution utilizing PCA

Air pollution is a concerning global environmental issue that poses a significant risk to human health and ecosystems as a whole. It is caused by the
release of harmful substances into the atmosphere, resulting from various human activities, industrial processes and natural sources. As the
detrimental effects of air pollution continue to emerge, researchers and policymakers are increasingly relying on statistical analysis to gain a deeper
insight into the patterns, sources and impacts involved.
What this project aims to delve into is the exploration and analysis of air pollution with data found in the HSAUR2 package. Mainly we will be looking
into several main characteristics of large cities and with the use of Sulfur Dioxide as the measure of air pollution we will analyze the influence of each
of the features involved.
Question of Interest: In this report we analyze the characteristics of 41 major cities to determine which of the provided six climate and ecological
variables are the most significant in determining air pollution. Here we use the annual mean concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2) as a measure of
the air pollution of a city.
Impact of result: Identifying key causes of air pollution can influence future policies implemented in larger cities. - Insights gained can inform
policymakers and government agencies in designing and implementing certain policies to combat air pollution. - By understanding factors influencing
pollution levels, healthcare professionals can better educate the public about associated health risks. - By identifying the sources and factors
contributing to pollution, environmental scientists can devise strategies to minimize the impact on wildlife of affected ecosystems which can in turn
contribute to the conservation and restoration of natural habitats and promote sustainable development practices. - This can also influence urban
planning decisions and infrastructure development, particularly in areas affected by high pollution levels. By understanding these factors, things like
public transportation systems and shifts to cleaner energy sources could be a focus for change.
Overall, the impact of project such as this lies in its potential to inform decision-making processes, drive policy change and bring overall awareness to
health and environmental changes brought about by the shifting climate
